Sub array
A subarray of array a of length n is a contiguous segment a[i] from  through a[j] where 0<i<j<n.
The sum of an array is the sum of its elements.
Given an  element array of integers,a, and an integer,m, determine the maximum value of the sum of any of its subarrays modulo m.

Example


The following table lists all subarrays and their moduli:

		sum	%2
[1]		1	1
[2]		2	0
[3]		3	1
[1,2]		3	1
[2,3]		5	1
[1,2,3]		6	0
The maximum modulus is .

Function Description

Complete the maximumSum function in the editor below.

maximumSum has the following parameter(s):

long a[n]: the array to analyze
long m: the modulo divisor
Returns
- long: the maximum (subarray sum modulo )

Input Format

The first line contains an integer q, the number of queries to perform.

The next q pairs of lines are as follows:

The first line contains two space-separated integers n and (long)m, the length  of a and the modulo divisor.
The second line contains  space-separated long integers .
